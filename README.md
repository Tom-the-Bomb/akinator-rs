# Akinator-rs
A simple crate wrapping around the undocumented akinator API,
based off of the preexisting [TypeScript](https://github.com/jgoralcz/aki-api) wrapper and also the python wrapper
which was deleted from github & pypi at the time of making (also what made me want to make my own)

### Examples
- See [the tests](https://github.com/Tom-the-Bomb/akinator-rs/blob/master/tests/test_akinator.rs) for a full example.
- Visit the [documentation](https://docs.rs/akinator-rs/latest/akinator_rs/) for more info

### Python bindings
python bindings made with [pyo3](https://pyo3.rs) can be found [here](https://github.com/Tom-the-Bomb/akinator.py)
